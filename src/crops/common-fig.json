Figs are native to the Middle East and western Asia and are grown for their fruit, which are also known as figs, and as an ornamental plant. In the right climate, they can grow as tall as 10 meters, but they can also be grown in containers and brought indoors in the winter in cooler regions. The plant has smooth white bark, deeply lobed fragrant leaves, and multiple, spreading trunks. Flowers are often pollinated by fig wasps, and develop into 3-5cm long fruit with green skin that, depending on the variety, can ripen to a deep purple. Figs need to ripen fully on the tree before harvest. They are ripe when they droop and are soft to the touch. If they ooze a white sap when they are pulled from the tree, they are not ripe. Fig trees have an aggressive root system that searches for groundwater in aquifers, ravines, and cracks in rocks. Once established, they can tolerate seasonal drought and are affected by few pests. Figs are propagated through cuttings or division, and generally produce fruit the year after planting. In warmer climates, they can produce two crops, one in early summer, and the other in fall.","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","sowing_method":"Cuttings, young tree, or seeds","spread":300,"row_spacing":500,"height":800,"processing_pictures":0,"guides_count":0,"main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","taxon":"Species","tags_array":[],"growing_degree_days":null,"svg_icon":null},"links":{"self":{"api":"/api/v1/crops/542e999d6331360002290600","website":"/crops/542e999d6331360002290600"}},"relationships":{"companions":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e999d6331360002290600/companions"},"data":[{"type":"crops","id":"59e115e6c86acd0004000019"}]},"pictures":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e999d6331360002290600/pictures"},"data":[{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8"},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e69963a4beeb00040000c9"},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e69967a4beeb00040000ca"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8","attributes":{"id":"59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8","photographic_id":"542e999d6331360002290600","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.?1508284761","small_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","medium_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","large_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","canopy_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761"}},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e69963a4beeb00040000c9","attributes":{"id":"59e69963a4beeb00040000c9","photographic_id":"542e999d6331360002290600","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.?1508284765","small_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.jpg?1508284765","thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.jpg?1508284765","medium_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.jpg?1508284765","large_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.jpg?1508284765","canopy_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69963a4beeb00040000c9.jpg?1508284765"}},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"59e69967a4beeb00040000ca","attributes":{"id":"59e69967a4beeb00040000ca","photographic_id":"542e999d6331360002290600","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.?1508284771","small_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.jpg?1508284771","thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.jpg?1508284771","medium_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.jpg?1508284771","large_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.jpg?1508284771","canopy_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e69967a4beeb00040000ca.jpg?1508284771"}},{"type":"crops","id":"59e115e6c86acd0004000019","attributes":{"name":"Elderberry","slug":"elderberry","binomial_name":"Sambucus","common_names":["elder","elderberry","black elder","European elder","European elderberry","European black elderberry"],"description":"Elderberry is a group of closely related species in the Sambucus genus native to Europe and North America. The varying species are small, perennial deciduous trees and shrubs that produce large clusters of small berries. European elderberry (Sambucus nigra) and the American elderberry (Sambucus canadensis) are among the most common species. The berries of the Red Elderberry (Sambucus racemosa) are poisonous. The plants produce bunches of white, hermaphrodite flowers that are pollinated by flies. Elderberries require cross-pollination with another variety within 15 meters. The glossy, dark purple to black berries are 3â€“5 mm diameter and grow in drooping clusters. Shrubs should be covered with netting to prevent birds from eating all the berries, and the fruit should be left on the plant to ripen until they are dark purple. Once ripened, prune the entire cluster. Berries should be kept refrigerated after harvest. All green parts of the plant are poisonous, and the berries are bitter and very mildly poisonous when raw. The berries can be used to make jam, jelly, and chutney. Syrup, tea, infusions, cordials, and fritters are made with the flowers. Elderberry wine can be made from the flowers and berries. Elderberries are very high in Vitamins A, B, and C, potassium, iron, and antioxidants and have been used to boost the immune system and treat the flu, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections and fever. Elderberries are propagated through cuttings and suckers. Their shallow roots do not like to be disturbed once they are established, and the plants are drought-sensitive. They will produce berries in the second year, and should be pruned in the spring of their third year.","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","sowing_method":"Cuttings or young plant","spread":null,"row_spacing":250,"height":6000,"processing_pictures":0,"guides_count":0,"main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e115ed5a97fa00040004a7.jpg?1507923432","taxon":"Species","tags_array":[],"growing_degree_days":null,"svg_icon":null},"links":{"self":{"api":"/api/v1/crops/59e115e6c86acd0004000019","website":"/crops/59e115e6c86acd0004000019"}},"relationships":{"companions":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e115e6c86acd0004000019/companions"}},"pictures":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e115e6c86acd0004000019/pictures"}}}}]}
