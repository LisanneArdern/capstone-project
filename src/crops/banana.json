There are many different species of banana within the Musa genus. Banana trees can be grown outdoors in tropic and subtropical climates, and indoors in northern areas. Bananas like company: plant them in blocks or clumps so they can shelter one another from wind and build humidity. The best bananas will grow towards the middle of the clump. Hot, dry air and temperatures below 0ºC will seriously harm or kill a banana tree.","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","sowing_method":"Rhizome or sucker","spread":null,"row_spacing":null,"height":4000,"processing_pictures":0,"guides_count":0,"main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476","taxon":"Genus","tags_array":[],"growing_degree_days":null,"svg_icon":null},"links":{"self":{"api":"/api/v1/crops/5939f8cff731ad0004000027","website":"/crops/5939f8cff731ad0004000027"}},"relationships":{"companions":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5939f8cff731ad0004000027/companions"},"data":[{"type":"crops","id":"5915b04646d9bb0004000044"},{"type":"crops","id":"59e00f424d87610004000036"},{"type":"crops","id":"5a29af406516800004000018"}]},"pictures":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5939f8cff731ad0004000027/pictures"},"data":[{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"5939f8db01f879000400000d"},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"5939f8e901f879000400000e"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"5939f8db01f879000400000d","attributes":{"id":"5939f8db01f879000400000d","photographic_id":"5939f8cff731ad0004000027","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.?1496971476","small_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476","thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476","medium_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476","large_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476","canopy_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8db01f879000400000d.jpg?1496971476"}},{"type":"crops-pictures","id":"5939f8e901f879000400000e","attributes":{"id":"5939f8e901f879000400000e","photographic_id":"5939f8cff731ad0004000027","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.?1496971484","small_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.jpg?1496971484","thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.jpg?1496971484","medium_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.jpg?1496971484","large_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.jpg?1496971484","canopy_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5939f8e901f879000400000e.jpg?1496971484"}},{"type":"crops","id":"5915b04646d9bb0004000044","attributes":{"name":"Cowpea","slug":"cowpea","binomial_name":"Vigna unguiculata","common_names":["black-eyed pea","southern pea","yardlong bean","catjang","crowder pea"],"description":"Cowpeas are an annual herbaceous legume in the genus Vigna. They have a high tolerance for sandy, infertile, acidic soil and low rainfall, making them an important crop for poor farmers in Africa and other semi-arid regions. Cowpeas need 90-100 frost-free days and their optimum growth temperature is 30°C. They are grown for human consumption, cattle feed, and as a cover crop. There are four subspecies of cowpea, three of which are cultivated. Common cultivars include black-eyed pea, southern pea, yardlong bean, catjang, and crowder pea. Cowpeas can be erect, semi-erect, or climbing. Their seeds are high in protein, and their leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed. The whole plant is used as forage for animals. They make a great cover crop or intercrop because their root nodules fix atmospheric nitrogen. They can produce as much as 315lb./acre of nitrogen. If growing as a cover crop, till under when the plants are flowering and before they go to seed.","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","sowing_method":"Direct seed outdoors, thin to 10cm","spread":null,"row_spacing":5,"height":90,"processing_pictures":0,"guides_count":0,"main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5915b04ab142660004002311.jpg?1494593609","taxon":"Species","tags_array":[],"growing_degree_days":null,"svg_icon":null},"links":{"self":{"api":"/api/v1/crops/5915b04646d9bb0004000044","website":"/crops/5915b04646d9bb0004000044"}},"relationships":{"companions":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5915b04646d9bb0004000044/companions"}},"pictures":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5915b04646d9bb0004000044/pictures"}}}},{"type":"crops","id":"59e00f424d87610004000036","attributes":{"name":"Durian","slug":"durian","binomial_name":"Durio zibethinus","common_names":["Durian","king of fruits"],"description":"Durian are large, evergreen tropical trees in the Durian genus and Malvaceae family that are grown for their fruit, which is also called Durian. The genus contains 30 species, 9 of which produce edible fruit. They are native to the equatorial tropics, and grow within 23° north or south of the equator. They are extremely cold-sensitive and require temperatures consistently between 24-30°C. Temperatures below 7°C will kill them. Durians require 75-90% humidity, an annual rainfall of 1600-4000mm, and soil with good drainage. They can grow to heights of 12-45 meters, but have a shallow root system and are susceptible to wind. The oblong or round fruit have a thorny, green to brown husk and can be up to 30cm long and 15cm in diameter and weigh 1-3 kilograms. They resemble jackfruit, which is an unrelated species. The flesh inside is pale yellow to red and has a powerful aroma that some find sweet while others describe as smelling like raw sewage or turpentine. The discrepancy in flavor perception is compounded by the fact that durians from different species have different aromas. The flesh can be eaten raw or used to flavor sweets like ice cream, cake, and beverages. The young leaves and shoots can be cooked as greens, and the flower petals are edible. Durians flower once or twice a year, producing large, feathery flowers with a buttery, sour scent that are pollinated by bats, birds, spiderhunters, and giant honey bees. Fruit take 3 months to mature after pollination. Durians are often propagated through grafting and start to bear fruit in 4-5 years. Genome sequencing has revealed that Durian’s closest earliest ancestor is the cacao plant.","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","sowing_method":"Transplant wedge or bud-grafted sapling","spread":null,"row_spacing":1200,"height":5000,"processing_pictures":0,"guides_count":0,"main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e105ed5a97fa00040004a6.jpg?1507919324","taxon":"Species","tags_array":[],"growing_degree_days":null,"svg_icon":null},"links":{"self":{"api":"/api/v1/crops/59e00f424d87610004000036","website":"/crops/59e00f424d87610004000036"}},"relationships":{"companions":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e00f424d87610004000036/companions"}},"pictures":{"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e00f424d87610004000036/pictures"}}}},{"type":"crops","id":"5a29af406516800004000018","attributes":{"name":"Yam","slug":"yam","binomial_name":"Dioscorea","common_names":null,"description":"Yams are a genus of over 870 species of perennial, herbaceous vines that form edible starchy tubers.
